<p><strong>Information automatically collected</strong></p>

<p><strong><em>In Short:</em></strong> <em>Some information — such as your Internet Protocol (IP) address and/or browser and device characteristics — is collected automatically when you visit our Services.</em></p>

  </li>
</ul>

<p><a name="legalbases"></a><strong>3. WHAT LEGAL BASES DO WE RELY ON TO PROCESS YOUR INFORMATION?</strong></p>

<p><em><strong>In Short:</strong> We only process your personal information when we believe it is necessary and we have a valid legal reason (i.e., legal basis) to do so under applicable law, like with your consent, to comply with laws, to provide you with services to enter into or fulfill our contractual obligations, to protect your rights, or to fulfill our legitimate business interests.</em></p>

<p><em><strong>If you are located in the EU or UK, this section applies to you.</strong></em></p>

<p>The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and UK GDPR require us to explain the valid legal bases we rely on in order to process your personal information. As such, we may rely on the following legal bases to process your personal information:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Consent.</strong> We may process your information if you have given us permission (i.e., consent) to use your personal information for a specific purpose. You can withdraw your consent at any time. Click <a href="#withdrawconsent">here</a> to learn more.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Legitimate Interests.</strong> We may process your information when we believe it is reasonably necessary to achieve our legitimate business interests and those interests do not outweigh your interests and fundamental rights and freedoms. For example, we may process your personal information for some of the purposes described in order to:</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Develop and display personalized and relevant advertising content for our users</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Legal Obligations.</strong> We may process your information where we believe it is necessary for compliance with our legal obligations, such as to cooperate with a law enforcement body or regulatory agency, exercise or defend our legal rights, or disclose your information as evidence in litigation in which we are involved.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Vital Interests.</strong> We may process your information where we believe it is necessary to protect your vital interests or the vital interests of a third party, such as situations involving potential threats to the safety of any person.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong><em>If you are located in Canada, this section applies to you.</em></strong></p>

<p>We may process your information if you have given us specific permission (i.e., express consent) to use your personal information for a specific purpose, or in situations where your permission can be inferred (i.e., implied consent). You can withdraw your consent at any time. Click <a href="#withdrawconsent">here</a> to learn more.</p>

<p>In some exceptional cases, we may be legally permitted under applicable law to process your information without your consent, including, for example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>If collection is clearly in the interests of an individual and consent cannot be obtained in a timely way</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For investigations and fraud detection and prevention</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For business transactions provided certain conditions are met</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If it is contained in a witness statement and the collection is necessary to assess, process, or settle an insurance claim</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For identifying injured, ill, or deceased persons and communicating with next of kin</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we have reasonable grounds to believe an individual has been, is, or may be victim of financial abuse</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If it is reasonable to expect collection and use with consent would compromise the availability or the accuracy of the information and the collection is reasonable for purposes related to investigating a breach of an agreement or a contravention of the laws of Canada or a province</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If disclosure is required to comply with a subpoena, warrant, court order, or rules of the court relating to the production of records</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If it was produced by an individual in the course of their employment, business, or profession and the collection is consistent with the purposes for which the information was produced</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the collection is solely for journalistic, artistic, or literary purposes</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the information is publicly available and is specified by the regulations</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Vendors, Consultants, and Other Third-Party Service Providers.</strong> We may share your data with third-party vendors, service providers, contractors, or agents (“<strong>third parties</strong>”) who perform services for us or on our behalf and require access to such information to do that work. We have contracts in place with our third parties, which are designed to help safeguard your personal information. This means that they cannot do anything with your personal information unless we have instructed them to do it. They will also not share your personal information with any organization apart from us. They also commit to protect the data they hold on our behalf and to retain it for the period we instruct. The categories of third parties we may share personal information with are as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Ad Networks</li>
</ul>

<p>We also may need to share your personal information in the following situations:</p>

</ul>

<p><a name="3pwebsites"></a><strong>5. WHAT IS OUR STANCE ON THIRD-PARTY WEBSITES?</strong></p>

<p><strong><em>In Short:</em></strong> <em>We are not responsible for the safety of any information that you share with third parties that we may link to or who advertise on our Services, but are not affiliated with, our Services.</em></p>

<p>The Services may link to third-party websites, online services, or mobile applications and/or contain advertisements from third parties that are not affiliated with us and which may link to other websites, services, or applications. Accordingly, we do not make any guarantee regarding any such third parties, and we will not be liable for any loss or damage caused by the use of such third-party websites, services, or applications. The inclusion of a link towards a third-party website, service, or application does not imply an endorsement by us. We cannot guarantee the safety and privacy of data you provide to any third parties. Any data collected by third parties is not covered by this privacy notice. We are not responsible for the content or privacy and security practices and policies of any third parties, including other websites, services, or applications that may be linked to or from the Services. You should review the policies of such third parties and contact them directly to respond to your questions.</p>

<p><a name="sociallogins"></a><strong>6. HOW DO WE HANDLE YOUR SOCIAL LOGINS?</strong></p>

<p><strong><em>In Short:</em></strong> <em>If you choose to register or log in to our Services using a social media account, we may have access to certain information about you.</em></p>

<p>Our Services offer you the ability to register and log in using your third-party social media account details (like your Facebook or Twitter logins). Where you choose to do this, we will receive certain profile information about you from your social media provider. The profile information we receive may vary depending on the social media provider concerned, but will often include your name, email address, friends list, and profile picture, as well as other information you choose to make public on such a social media platform.</p>

<p>We will use the information we receive only for the purposes that are described in this privacy notice or that are otherwise made clear to you on the relevant Services. Please note that we do not control, and are not responsible for, other uses of your personal information by your third-party social media provider. We recommend that you review their privacy notice to understand how they collect, use, and share your personal information, and how you can set your privacy preferences on their sites and apps.</p>

<p><a name="intltransfers"></a><strong>7. IS YOUR INFORMATION TRANSFERRED INTERNATIONALLY?</strong></p>

<p><strong><em>In Short:</em></strong> <em>We may transfer, store, and process your information in countries other than your own.</em></p>

<p>Our servers are located in. If you are accessing our Services from outside, please be aware that your information may be transferred to, stored, and processed by us in our facilities and by those third parties with whom we may share your personal information (see “<a href="#whoshare">WHEN AND WITH WHOM DO WE SHARE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?</a>” above), in and other countries.</p>

<p>If you are a resident in the European Economic Area (EEA) or United Kingdom (UK), then these countries may not necessarily have data protection laws or other similar laws as comprehensive as those in your country. However, we will take all necessary measures to protect your personal information in accordance with this privacy notice and applicable law.</p>

<p><a name="inforetain"></a><strong>8. HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?</strong></p>

<p><strong><em>In Short:</em></strong> <em>We keep your information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this privacy notice unless otherwise required by law.</em></p>

<p>We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out in this privacy notice, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting, or other legal requirements).</p>

<p>When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize such information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.</p>

<p><a name="infosafe"></a><strong>9. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?</strong></p>

<p><strong><em>In Short:</em></strong> <em>We aim to protect your personal information through a system of organizational and technical security measures.</em></p>

<p>We have implemented appropriate and reasonable technical and organizational security measures designed to protect the security of any personal information we process. However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorized third parties will not be able to defeat our security and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information. Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, transmission of personal information to and from our Services is at your own risk. You should only access the Services within a secure environment.</p>

<p><a name="privacyrights"></a><strong>10. WHAT ARE YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS?</strong></p>

<p><strong><em>In Short:</em></strong> <em>In some regions, such as the European Economic Area (EEA), United Kingdom (UK), and Canada, you have rights that allow you greater access to and control over your personal information. You may review, change, or terminate your account at any time.</em></p>

<p>In some regions (like the EEA, UK, and Canada), you have certain rights under applicable data protection laws. These may include the right (i) to request access and obtain a copy of your personal information, (ii) to request rectification or erasure; (iii) to restrict the processing of your personal information; and (iv) if applicable, to data portability. In certain circumstances, you may also have the right to object to the processing of your personal information. You can make such a request by contacting us by using the contact details provided in the section “<a href="#contact">HOW CAN YOU CONTACT US ABOUT THIS NOTICE?</a>” below.</p>

<p>We will consider and act upon any request in accordance with applicable data protection laws.</p>

<p>If you are located in the EEA or UK and you believe we are unlawfully processing your personal information, you also have the right to complain to your local data protection supervisory authority. You can find their contact details here: <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/bodies/authorities/index_en.htm">https://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/bodies/authorities/index_en.htm</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Withdrawing your consent:</strong> If we are relying on your consent to process your personal information, which may be express and/or implied consent depending on the applicable law, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. You can withdraw your consent at any time by contacting us by using the contact details provided in the section “<a href="#contact">HOW CAN YOU CONTACT US ABOUT THIS NOTICE?</a>” below.</p>

<p><a name="DNT"></a><strong>11. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</strong></p>

<p>Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track (“DNT”) feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage no uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this privacy notice.</p>

<p><a name="caresidents"></a><strong>12. DO CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS HAVE SPECIFIC PRIVACY RIGHTS?</strong></p>

<p><strong><em>In Short:</em></strong> <em>Yes, if you are a resident of California, you are granted specific rights regarding access to your personal information.</em></p>

<p>California Civil Code Section 1798.83, also known as the “Shine The Light” law, permits our users who are California residents to request and obtain from us, once a year and free of charge, information about categories of personal information (if any) we disclosed to third parties for direct marketing purposes and the names and addresses of all third parties with which we shared personal information in the immediately preceding calendar year. If you are a California resident and would like to make such a request, please submit your request in writing to us using the contact information provided below.</p>

<p>If you are under 18 years of age, reside in California, and have a registered account with Services, you have the right to request removal of unwanted data that you publicly post on the Services. To request removal of such data, please contact us using the contact information provided below and include the email address associated with your account and a statement that you reside in California. We will make sure the data is not publicly displayed on the Services, but please be aware that the data may not be completely or comprehensively removed from all our systems (e.g., backups, etc.).</p>

<p><strong>CCPA Privacy Notice</strong></p>

<p>The California Code of Regulations defines a “resident” as:</p>

<p>(1) every individual who is in the State of California for other than a temporary or transitory purpose and</p>

<p>(2) every individual who is domiciled in the State of California who is outside the State of California for a temporary or transitory purpose</p>

<p>All other individuals are defined as “non-residents.”</p>

<p>Right to Non-Discrimination for the Exercise of a Consumer’s Privacy Rights</p>

<p>We will not discriminate against you if you exercise your privacy rights.</p>

<p>Right to Limit Use and Disclosure of Sensitive Personal Information</p>

<p>We do not process consumer’s sensitive personal information.</p>

<p>Verification process</p>

<p>Upon receiving your request, we will need to verify your identity to determine you are the same person about whom we have the information in our system. These verification efforts require us to ask you to provide information so that we can match it with information you have previously provided us. For instance, depending on the type of request you submit, we may ask you to provide certain information so that we can match the information you provide with the information we already have on file, or we may contact you through a communication method (e.g., phone or email) that you have previously provided to us. We may also use other verification methods as the circumstances dictate.</p>

<p>We will only use personal information provided in your request to verify your identity or authority to make the request. To the extent possible, we will avoid requesting additional information from you for the purposes of verification. However, if we cannot verify your identity from the information already maintained by us, we may request that you provide additional information for the purposes of verifying your identity and for security or fraud-prevention purposes. We will delete such additionally provided information as soon as we finish verifying you.</p>

  <li>
    <p>You may object to the processing of your personal information.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You may request correction of your personal data if it is incorrect or no longer relevant, or ask to restrict the processing of the information.</p>
  </li>
